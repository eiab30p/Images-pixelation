<h1><strong>Brief Blurb:</strong></h1>
For this project, I tried to create a program that makes any image look like a retro 8-bit
pixelated image. I came up with this idea while playing <i>Mario Kart</i> with some friends.
I started the process by reading about<i>Dither</i>. I eventually wrote <i>Dither</i> algorithm
but it came out as more static than pixelated. Therefore, with some influence of
<i>Ditherâ€™s Algorithm</i> I wrote a program that met most of my expectations. As you can
see in the images below I took the original selfie and made it pixelated.

<img src="./Me.jpg" height="408" alt="Selfie of Eddy at the Grand Canyon">
<img src="pixelated_image.jpg" height="408" alt="Pixelated Selfie of Eddy at the Grand Canyon">
